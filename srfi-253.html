<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>
  Data validation and type checking (supposedly) make for more correct code.
  And faster code too, sometimes.
  And, in rare cases, code that's easier to follow than the un-checked one.
  Unfortunately, Scheme does not have many (type-)checking primitives out of the box.
  This SRFI provides some, with the aim of allowing more performant and correct code with minimum effort on the user side.
  Both (manual) argument checking/validation (<a href="#spec--check-arg"><code>check-arg</code></a>)
  and return value(s) (<a href="#spec--values-checked"><code>values-checked</code></a>) checking/coercion are provided.
  Syntax sugar like <a href="#spec--define-checked"><code>define-checked</code></a>
  and <a href="#spec--define-record-type-checked"><code>define-record-type-checked</code></a> is added on top.
</p>

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

<p>None at present.</p>

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

<p>
  Many Scheme code bases grow to a certain point—a point where entropy creates too diverse of an input set to ignore.
  That's the moment most programmers turn to contracts (in a loose sense of the word) and data validation.
  Other languages have type systems, object-orientation, type polymorphism, and other systems establishing code contracts.
  Scheme doesn't.
</p>
<p>
  Scheme programmers and projects often compile a set of validation utilities.
  Be it for correctness (reliable data structure libraries, foreign function interfaces.)
  Or for speed (game engines, numeric libraries.)
  These utilities come in many shapes and implementations, but they can be split into several groups:
</p>

<ol>
  <li id="use-case-1"> Argument/data validation.
  <li id="use-case-2"> Value coercion.
  <li id="use-case-3"> Function/value/record type declaration.
  <li id="use-case-4"> Type/property/predicate dispatching.
</ol>

<p>
  Implementations cater to these needs and cases, providing special forms/macros, usually for type declaration.
  The syntax and semantics of these differ wildly, though.
  If one wants to write correct, strongly typed, or performant code,
  one is stuck with non-portable APIs and implementation-specific hacks.
  Thus the need for standardization—one needs portable ways to ensure code validity/strictness.
</p>
<p>
  SRFIs most closely related to this one (and their differences) are:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-145/">SRFI-145 (assume)</a></dt>
  <dd>
    One of the cited reasons for <code>assume</code> is performance gains.
    Which is consistent with this SRFI.
    The difference is the scope—this SRFI provides primitives covering most categories above.
    While <code>assume</code> is exclusively restricted to generic condition checking <a href="#use-case-1">(1)</a>.
    And practical use of <code>assume</code> is too wordy, a more inlined syntax (like <a href="#spec--lambda-checked"><code>lambda-checked</code></a>) never hurts.
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-187/">SRFI-187 (alambda)</a> and the like</dt>
  <dd>
    A withdrawn family of SRFIs, the only ones bearing the "Type Checking" category.
    Fully covering the case of data validation and are good at establishing contracts in general.
    A few (minor) flaws: they're withdrawn; and the scope of the alambda SRFI is explicitly wider than type checking, mostly focusing on procedure arguments <a href="#use-case-3">(3)</a> in general.
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-143/">SRFI-143 (Fixnums)</a>
    and <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-144/">SRFI-144 (Flonums)</a></dt>
  <dd>
    SRFIs defining two types of numbers that are "close to the metal" in being size and functionality restricted.
    These SRFIs are already used by multiple implementations (Guile and PreScheme, notably) in code optimization.
    And the notion of types is permeating both SRFIs.
    The downside of both flonum and fixnum SRFIs is that they don't generalize to more types.
    Which is a virtue in their particular context, but loss in terms of general (type-)checking.
    This SRFI fills the gap for more types.
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
  See the <a href="#prior">Prior art</a> section for more references and context.
</p>

<p>
  This SRFI is novel in that it introduces a set of primitives explicitly geared for predicate/type checking.
  It is designed so that implementations can turn these primitives into cheap and strong type checks if need be.
  (The sample implementation already includes multiple implementation-specific optimizations, which proves the point.)
  No other goal is pursued but allowing more correct, strict, and optimized Scheme code.
</p>

<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

<p>
  Provided APIs can conceptually be split into two parts: basic and derived.
  (The distinction won't be reflected in this section structure, but should be trivial to guess.)
  Derived APIs are merely a syntactic sugar over basic primitives, but they are too useful for everyday programming to be left out.
  Derived operations also mirror the way some implementations handle typing/contracts at the procedure/record level.
  This solidifies the existing practice, making it convenient to reproduce.
</p>

<p id="it-is-an-error">
  It is recommended that implementations actually throw checking errors in all the "it is an error" cases below.
  At least in debug mode.
  The possible type of error might be <code>&amp;assertion</code>.
  Implementations are free to follow the original permissive "it is an error" behavior whenever deemed necessary, though.
</p>

<h3 id="spec--check-arg">(check-arg predicate arg [caller])</h3>

<p>
  Guarantees that the <code>arg</code> (evaluated) conforms to the <code>predicate</code> (evaluated).
  Implementations can enforce the predicate check in all the code that follows, but are not required to.
  <a href="#it-is-an-error">It is an error</a> if <code>predicate</code> returns <code>#f</code> when called on <code>arg</code>.
  Otherwise, returns non-false value.
  Implementations may use optional <code>caller</code> (evaluated) argument as the error who/origin if/when signaling a checking error.
</p>

<p>
  One possible implementation, as found in SRFI-1, might be:
</p>

<pre>
(define (check-arg pred val caller)
  (let lp ((val val))
    (if (pred val) val (lp (error "Bad argument" val pred caller)))))
</pre>

<p>
  Inspired by Common Lisp <code>check-type</code> special form.
</p>

<h3 id="spec--values-checked">(values-checked (predicates ...) values ...)</h3>

<p>
  Guarantees that the <code>values</code> (evaluated) abide by the given <code>predicates</code> (evaluated)
  (the number of values and predicates should match) and returns them as multiple values.
  <a href="#it-is-an-error">It is an error</a> if any of the <code>predicates</code> returned false.
  Implementations may choose to coerce the values when the types are compatible (e.g. integer -> inexact).
  Supports multiple values:
</p>

<pre>
(values-checked (integer?) 9) ;; Single value
(values-checked (integer? string?) 9 "hello") ;; Multiple values
(values-checked (integer? real? char?) 9 83.12 #\a) ;; More values
(values-checked (integer?) 9.0) ;; 9 or 9.0
(values-checked (string?) 9) ;; => unspecified, is an error
</pre>

<p>
  Notice that single value form still has the parentheses around the only predicate.
  This is to avoid ambiguity.
  Implementations must not omit parentheses.
  If presence of parentheses was a marker for multiple values, then more complex predicate would break it:
</p>

<pre>
(values-checked (cut = &lt;> 3) 9)
</pre>

<p>
  <code>values-checked</code> is inspired by Common Lisp <code>the</code> special form
  (one can already see the author comes from Common Lisp world,)
  declaring the unambiguous type for the return value.
  The same inspiration can be traced in some Scheme implementations, like Chicken
  (see <a href="#prior--implementations">(Prior Art) Implementations</a>).
</p>

<h3 id="spec--check-case">(check-case value (predicate body ...) ... [(else else-body ...)])</h3>

<p>
  <code>check-case</code> check the <code>value</code> for satisfying one of the <code>predicate</code>-s.
  In case any of the <code>predicate</code>-s is satisfied, it evaluates the respective <code>body</code>.
  In case none of the <code>predicate</code>-s are satisfied:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> If there's a last <code>else</code> clause, evaluate the respective <code>else-body</code>.
  <li> Otherwise, <a href="#it-is-an-error">it is an error</a>.
</ul>

<p>
  The return value is that of the satisfied clause <code>body</code>, <code>else-body</code> (when <code>else</code> clause is provided and no other clause matches), or unspecified.
</p>

<pre>
(check-case x
 (integer? (+ 1 x)) ;; Return x + 1 if x is an integer.
 (string? (+ 1 (string->number x)))) ;; Return x' + 1 where x' is read from x.
;; Otherwise (x is neither integer? nor string?), <a href="#it-is-an-error">it is an error</a>.
</pre>

<p>
  Inspired by Common Lisp's <a href="https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_tpcase.htm">typecase</a> family of macros.
  And Chicken's <a href="https://wiki.call-cc.org/man/5/Types#compiler-typecase">compiler-typecase</a> (already used/optimized in the sample implementation.)
</p>

<h3 id="spec--lambda-checked">(lambda-checked (args ...) body ...)</h3>

<p>
  A regular lambda, but with any argument (except the rest argument) optionally having the form <code>(name predicate)</code>
  (as compared to default single-symbol form).
  Arguments of this extended form are guaranteed to satisfy the respective (evaluated) <code>predicate</code>.
  At least on procedure application time.
  This guarantee might be extended for all the procedure body, including for any modification and shadowing, at implementors' will.
  <a href="#it-is-an-error">It is an error</a> if either of the arguments does not satisfy the predicate.
</p>

<pre>
;; See <a href="#implementation--caveat-rest-arg">(Implementation) Caveat: Rest Argument Support Is Uneven</a> for the caveats of using . rest pattern.
(define error
  (lambda-checked ((who symbol?) (message string?) . irritants)
    ...))
</pre>

<h3 id="spec--case-lambda-checked">(case-lambda-checked ((args ...) body ...) ...)</h3>

<p>
  Same as <code>case-lambda</code>, but with any argument taking a form of <code>(name predicate)</code> to be checked.
  See <a href="#spec--lambda-checked">lambda-checked</a> section for other details.
</p>

<p>
  Important note: <code>case-lambda</code> does not dispatch over its argument types <a href="#use-case-4">(4)</a>,
  it only checks them <a href="#use-case-3">(3)</a>.
  The only dispatching that happens is argument number dispatching.
</p>

<h3 id="spec--define-checked">(define-checked (name args ...) body ...) | (define-checked name predicate value)</h3>

<p>
  Defines a procedure or variable satisfying the given predicates.
  For procedures, effectively equal to <code>define+lambda-checked</code>:
</p>

<pre>
(define-checked (error (who symbol?) (message string?) . irritants)
  ...)
</pre>

<p>
  For variables, checks the <code>value</code> (and, if implementation supports that, all the subsequent modifications) for the <code>predicate</code> match.
</p>

<pre>
(define-checked message string? "Hi!")
</pre>

<h3 id="spec--define-record-type-checked">(define-record-type-checked type-name (constructor arg-name ...) predicate field ...)</h3>

<p>
  Defines a record type with checked constructor and field accessors/modifiers.
  <code>type-name</code>, <code>constructor</code>, and <code>predicate</code> are the same as R<sup>7</sup>RS <code>define-record-type</code>'s
  (note especially the constructor—checks are not allowed in it, only <code>arg-name</code> symbols!)
  Fields are either of the form <code>(field-name predicate accessor-name)</code> or <code>(field-name predicate accessor-name modifier-name)</code>.
  These ensure that accessor and modifier return checked data and check new data respectively.
  <a href="#it-is-an-error">It is an error</a> if any of the checks are not successful.
</p>

<p>
  <code>define-record-type-checked</code> also guarantees that initial values passed to constructor are satisfying the predicates provided in field specification.
</p>

<p>
  <code>define-record-type-checked</code> is modeled after PreScheme's <code>define-record-type</code>.
</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>
  Sample implementation is done in standard syntax-rules, which makes it fairly portable and minimalist.
  Chicken, Kawa, STklos, and Gauche-specific definitions with stronger typing/checking are also provided as <code>cond-expand</code>-s.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="srfi/impl.scm">Source for the portable sample implementation.</a>
  See the <a href="https://github.com/scheme-requests-for-implementation/srfi-253">SRFI repository</a>
  for other useful files.
</p>

<p>
  Tested at least on
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Guile: full support
  <li> Kawa: full support, <code>values-checked</code> coerces values whenever possible
  <li> STklos: full support
  <li> Chicken: partial support, with type checking only working in compile-time and rest argument support missing.
  <li> Gauche: partial support:
    <ul>
      <li> Rest arguments are not supported.
      <li> <code>check-arg</code> shadows the syntax provided by <code>(gauche base)</code>...
      <li>... and makes additional type checks with Gauche object system.
    </ul>
  <li> Gambit and Gerbil: broken, undebugged due to insufficient understanding of the implementation
</ul>

<h3 id="implementation--caveat-rest-arg">Caveat: Rest Argument Support Is Uneven</h3>

<p>
  Significant limitation: sample implementation does not support rest arguments in <code>lambda-checked</code> and other lambda macros <em>on some implementations</em>.
  Notably Chicken and Gauche, because these don't allow rest pattern in macros.
  Sample implementation should seamlessly support rest arguments on implementations allowing them.
</p>

<h3 id="implementation--check-arg-macro">check-arg—procedure or macro?</h3>

<p>
  Most SRFIs that use <code>check-arg</code> (1, 13, 44, 152) define it as a procedure.
  Sample implementation defines it as a macro,
  mostly to reuse more optimizable <code>assert</code>/<code>assume</code> underneath.
  Implementations are free to make it a procedure, and it should work like one.
</p>

<h2 id="prior">Prior Art</h2>

<p>
  This section is not normative.
  It is mostly a result of review of all the accessible SRFIs.
  (At the moment of writing, 0-252.)
  And, occasionally, implementation manuals and (mostly Guile-based) real-world programs.
  There are emergent patterns worth optimizing, and that's what this SRFI does.
</p>

<h3 id="prior--conditionals">Guarding conditionals</h3>

<p>
  One's code only accepts certain types of things.
  The simplest way to ensure that the arguments are the right type of things is to check, which is what <code>cond</code> is for:
</p>

<pre>
(cond
 ((integer? x) (+ 1 x))
 ((string? x) (+ 1 (string->number x)))
 (else ???))
</pre>

<p>
  This pattern has two problems:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> One needs to list out all the conditions and potentially duplicate code.
  <li> It's not clear what to do when none of the conditions are satisfied.
</ul>

<h3 id="prior--check-x">Ad hoc checks: check-*</h3>

<p>
  One obvious action on data mismatch is to raise an error.
  That's what the conventional <code>check-*</code> procedures tend to do.
  Check that conditions are satisfied and error out if they don't <a href="#use-case-1">(1)</a>.
  Something like what SRFI-144 does:
</p>

<pre>
(define (check-flonum! name x)
  (if (not (flonum? x))
      (error (string-append "non-flonum argument passed to "
                            (symbol->string name))
             x)))
</pre>

<p>
  The benefit of this pattern is that one can put a single <code>check-*</code> form at the start of the procedure and be done with it (SRFI-144 again):
</p>

<pre>
(define (flop1 name op)
  (lambda (x)
    (check-flonum! name x)
    (let ((result (op x)))
      (if (not (flonum? result))
          (error (string-append "non-flonum result from "
                                (symbol->string name))
                 result))
      result)))
</pre>

<p>
  The most prevalent example of this strategy is the <code>check-arg</code>, giving the name to one of the primitives in this SRFI.
  It's present in SRFI-1, SRFI-13, SRFI-44, SRFI-152, and likely some others.
  The canonical implementation (as found in SRFI-1) is
</p>

<pre>
(define (check-arg pred val caller)
  (let lp ((val val))
    (if (pred val) val (lp (error "Bad argument" val pred caller)))))
</pre>

<h3 id="prior--coercion-ensure">Coercion: ensure-*</h3>

<p>
  Another strategy of dealing with malformed data is trying to coerce/fix it <a href="#use-case-2">(2)</a>.
  That's what conventional <code>ensure-*</code> procedure do:
</p>

<pre>
;; SRFI-175
(define (ensure-int x) (if (char? x) (char->integer x) x))
</pre>

<p>
  The benefit of the approach is that one is always certain the data is well-formed (to a certain extent.)
  Some data is too broken to be coerced, which raises a need for checking and erroring out.
</p>

<h3 id="prior--assume-assert">SRFI-145 (assume) and R6RS (assert)</h3>

<p>
  Another way to check that things are in order <a href="#use-case-1">(1)</a> is using the R<sup>6</sup>RS <code>assert</code> or SRFI-145 <code>assume</code>.
  These are primitives allowing to check whether the given expression is true and error out if it isn't.
  Same as <code>check-*</code> procedures, but more generic.
</p>

<p>
  <code>assume</code>, in particular, is used in at least 9 SRFIs, mostly to do simple predicate checks.
  This use pattern highlights the need for predicate-checking primitive.
  A new primitive that might be tuned for performance, because performance is one of the motivations behind <code>assume</code> SRFI.
</p>

<p>
  One problem with <code>assume</code> is that it gets too verbose at times.
  To the point of being longer than the actual procedure body.
  Take this example from SRFI-214:
</p>

<pre>
(define (flexvector-ref fv index)
  (assume (flexvector? fv))
  (assume (integer? index))
  (assume (&lt; -1 index (flexvector-length fv)))
  (vector-ref (vec fv) index))
</pre>

<p>
  One needs a shorter (likely inlined in the procedure definition) way to provide types/predicates.
  Otherwise it&#39;s too much visual clutter.
</p>

<h3 id="prior--implementations">Implementation-specific (typing) primitives</h3>

<p>
  Most big implementations caring for performance or correctness provide typing/checking APIs.
  The problem of <code>assume</code> verbosity from the previous section is solved at least by Bigloo, Chicken, Gambit/Gerbil, Kawa, and Typed Racket.
  Either through inline types in procedure definition
</p>

<pre>
;; Kawa/Bigloo
(define (a x::integer)
  x)
;; Gambit
(define-procedure (a (x integer))
  x)
;; Typed Racket
(define a (lambda ([x : Integer]) x))
</pre>

<p>
  or through the separate declaration forms
</p>

<pre>
;; Chicken
(: a (integer -> integer))
;; Typed Racket
(: a (-> Integer Integer))
</pre>

<p>
  With these ways to check procedures <a href="#use-case-3">(3)</a> for types (and sometimes predicates, with custom types some implementations provide) one gets 90% there.
  Procedures are almost all there is to Scheme, after all.
</p>
<p>
  But some implementations aim for more, rivaling systems like Common Lisp or even statically typed languages.
  Chicken provides <code>the</code> for return type checking <a href="#use-case-2">(2)</a>, and Kawa provides <code>as</code>, which additionally coerces the values whenever possible.
  Chicken also has the <code>assume</code> form (not to be confused with SRFI-145), which pins the variables to types for the duration of the body <a href="#use-case-1">(1)</a>.
  Chicken even has <code>compiler-typecase</code> to cover type dispatch <a href="#use-case-4">(4)</a>.
  <a href="https://wiki.call-cc.org/man/5/Types">Chicken has a whole assortment of checking tools.</a>
</p>

<h3 id="prior--other-lisps">Other Lisps: Common Lisp, Clojure</h3>

<p>
  Most of these things won't be a surprise after talking about how advanced Scheme implementations get.
  Still, doesn't hurt highlighting things that likely were an inspiration (from Common Lisp) and that enhance the state of the art (in Clojure) of type/predicate checks.
</p>

<p>
  The main departure point for this library is Common Lisp.
  Having <a href="https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_assert.htm"><code>assert</code></a>
  and <a href="https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_check_.htm"><code>check-type</code></a>
  for <a href="#use-case-1">(1)</a>;
  <a href="https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/s_the.htm"><code>the</code></a>
  and <a href="https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_coerce.htm"><code>coerce</code></a> for <a href="#use-case-2">(2)</a>;
  <a href="https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/s_declar.htm"><code>declare</code></a>
  for <a href="#use-case-3">(3)</a>;
  and <a href="https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_tpcase.htm"><code>(e|c|)typecase</code></a>
  (not even mentioning the object system and type-dispatched methods) for <a href="#use-case-4">(4)</a>,
  it's covering most of what one needs with types/predicates.
  Thanks to gradual strong typing system integrated into the language.
</p>

<p>
  Clojure, while being restricted by JVM and functional design, has type annotations, conveniently allowing one to attach types to values <a href="#use-case-2">(2)</a>.
  It also has <a href="https://clojure.org/reference/special_forms#_fn_name_param_condition_map_expr_2">pre/post conditions</a>
  for functions, allowing to check the argument validity <a href="#use-case-3">(3)</a>.
  And, finally, there's <a href="https://clojure.org/news/2016/05/23/introducing-clojure-spec"><code>clojure.spec</code></a> that allows to define arbitrarily complex checks for data and match things to the contracts <a href="#use-case-1">(1)</a>.
